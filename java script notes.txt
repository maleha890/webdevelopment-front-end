ii) two dimentional array:(two dimentional array consist of more than one row and coloum it is called matrix or 2d array.)
16. function:-
function is a block of code that execute its body when it is called on a event.
there are two types of funtion:-
i) built-in(the function that is written by the language developer is called build-in function.There are two types of build-in function:i)null function ii) parametrized)
ii) user defined(the function that is written by its own is called user defined funtions.There are two types of user-defined function:i)null function ii)parametrized)
17. Query selector:-
it returns only one selector(but not used becuase if we want to select only one clas then we can use id)
18. query selector all:-
It return all same class element in a list. We can manipulate list using loop.
19. Arrays built-in-function:-
i) length()
ii) push()
